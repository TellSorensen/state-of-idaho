		<p>The area that came to be known as Boise was originally frequented by fur trappers as early as 1812 and gained increased notoriety in a gold rush in 1862. However, the city began developing to provide resources to the local gold mines in proximity to the newly established fort Boise in 1863. </p>
		<p>The city of Boise has served as Idahoâ€™s capital since December of 1864, over twenty years before the Idaho territory was granted statehood. </p>
