		<p>Originally frequented by fur trappers as early as 1812 and gaining increased notoriety in a gold rush in 1862, Boise began developing as a community to provide resources to local gold mines in proximity to the newly established fort Boise in 1863. The city of Boise has served as Idahoâ€™s capital since December of 1864, over twenty years before the Idaho territory was granted statehood. </p>
